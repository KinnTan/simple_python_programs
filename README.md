# Simple Python Programs  

This repository contains basic Python programs categorized into different batches. Each program focuses on different aspects of Python, including arithmetic operations, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.  

## Batch 1

1. **check_numbers_equal.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints "Equal" if the numbers are the same.
2. **count_odd_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and prints how many of them are odd.
3. **power_of_two_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints the result when the first number is raised to the power of the second.
4. **print_bigger_number.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints the bigger one.
5. **print_even_numbers_0_to_100.py** - Prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 using a for loop.
6. **print_numbers_exclude_ending_zero.py** - Prints all numbers from 0 to 100, excluding those ending in zero.
7. **product_two_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints their product.
8. **quotient_two_numbers_decimal.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints the quotient, including decimal places.
9. **sum_of_ten_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and prints their sum.
10. **sum_two_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints their sum.

## Batch 2

1. **check_numbers_not_equal.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints "Not Equal" if the numbers are different.
2. **count_even_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and prints how many of them are even.
3. **difference_two_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints their difference.
4. **print_numbers_between_two_inputs.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints all numbers between them.
5. **print_numbers_exclude_ending_zero_five.py** - Prints all numbers from 0 to 100, excluding those ending in zero or five.
6. **print_odd_numbers_0_to_100.py** - Prints all odd numbers from 0 to 100 using a while loop.
7. **print_smaller_number.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints the smaller one.
8. **quotient_without_decimal.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints the quotient without decimal places.
9. **remainder_of_division.py** - Asks the user to input two numbers and prints the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.
10. **subtract_from_first_number.py** - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and subtracts all subsequent numbers from the first one.

## Batch 3

1. **display_all_numbers_once.py** - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and displays all numbers without duplicates.
2. **display_unique_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and displays only the unique ones.
3. **find_lowest_number_in_input.py** - Continuously asks for input until the user enters an invalid number, then displays the lowest number entered.
4. **sort_numbers_ascending.py** - Continuously asks for input until the user enters an invalid number, then sorts and displays all entered numbers in ascending order.
5. **unique_or_duplicate.py** - Continuously asks for input until the user enters an invalid number, then checks if the number is unique or a duplicate.

## Batch 4

1. **calculate_average.py** - Asks the user to input numbers and calculates the average.
2. **find_highest_number.py** - Asks the user to input numbers and determines the highest number entered.
3. **most_frequent_number.py** - Asks the user to input numbers and finds the most frequently occurring number.
4. **print_duplicate_numbers.py** - Asks the user to input numbers and displays only the duplicate numbers.
5. **sort_numbers_descending.py** - Asks the user to input numbers and sorts them in descending order.
